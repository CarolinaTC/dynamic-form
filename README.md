 - To add a field, the user must first choose the field type and then the properties (label, field name, options, etc);
 - When the user clicks on Add Field, it should reflect on the form on the left side and reset the setting on the right side;
 - The form must persist when the user refreshes the page or leaves the page;
 - When clicking submit, log to the console an object of the form, the key being the "Field Name" and the value the user input (output example below);

```json
{
   "name":"John Doe",
   "age":"27",
   "address":"Street name"
}
```
